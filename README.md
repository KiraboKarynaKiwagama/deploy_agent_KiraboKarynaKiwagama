Explaining how to run the script and how to trigger the archive feature.
This script runs by putting in the command ./setup_project.sh. 
Then you will be presented with a menu, and you may decide which of the options you want to go ahead with. 
According to whichever option you picked, you will then have a specific task run.
Some tasks require previous ones to have been run for them to run well.
There will also be the option to run all the steps at once.
